Trust Game Replication – Code Only

This repository contains **only the analysis code** for a replication of the study:  
**No Matter of Trust: Retrieval of Observationally Acquired Stimulus-Response Bindings Occurs in Interactions With Both Trustworthy and Untrustworthy Partners**  
(Franke, K., Keller, N., Rothermund, K., Hommel, B., & Giesen, C. G., 2025, *Collabra: Psychology*, 11(1), 142732).

## Original Paper
- Full paper: [Read it on Collabra: Psychology](https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/11/1/142732/212612/No-Matter-of-Trust-Retrieval-of-Observationally)  
  (Investigates how trust (manipulated via an Investment Game variant) affects observational stimulus-response binding and retrieval effects in online interactions.)

## Original Data & Materials
Raw data files are large (>200 MB) and therefore **not included** in this repo.  
Download them from the official Open Science Framework (OSF) project page:  
[https://osf.io/9yj3a/](https://osf.io/9yj3a/)  
(Includes all experimental files, datasets, and analysis scripts from the original study.)

## Replication Content
- `Nov20Exp2.ipynb` – Full analysis and results for Experiment 2 (replicating the trust manipulation and oSRBR effects).  
  (Experiment 1 notebook coming soon — focuses on baseline observational SR binding without trust modulation.)

## Project Status
Work in progress: Partial replication of the original findings. Early results show consistent oSRBR effects across trust conditions, aligning with the paper's conclusions.
